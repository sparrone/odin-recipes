        <h1>Chicken Katsu</h1>
        <p>Serves 2 people</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>Panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Neutral oil(canola, peanut, etc)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook your rice. Theres a hundred different methods to achieve perfect rice.
                You can figure it out, I believe in you.
            </li>
            <li>Cut the chicken breast in half to create two thin pieces of chicken</li>
            <li>Flatten each half of chicken breast. Cover halved chicken breast with plastic wrap,<br>
                butcher paper, or place in ziploc bag. We don't want to spray raw chicken juices <br>
                everywhere. Flatten pieces of chicken with mallet, bottom of skillet, or rolling pin. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Salt both sides of chicken</li>
            <li>Coat both sides of chicken with flour</li>
            <li>Dip chicken in beaten egg. Make sure all parts of chicken are covered in egg</li>
            <li>Coat egg-covered chicken with panko breadcrumbs. Press as many breadcrumbs into <br>
                chicken as possible. We want a thick coating of crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>Fry the chicken in the oil. I'll add more desription here later.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And thats it. You have your rice and your chicken katsu. Top with whatever sauce you want, <br>
            maybe add some sliced green onions if you're feeling fancy. Do whatever you want with it.
