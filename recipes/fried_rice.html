        <h1>Fried Rice</h1>
        <p>Serves 1 person, I think</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooked, day old cold rice</li>
            <li>Cooking fat(oil, bacon grease, any fat that can withstand high heat)</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Onion(Green, yellow, shallot, whatever you want)</li>
            <li>Literally any vegetable</li>
            <li>Literally any meat you want</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Any sauce or condiment that you like(Oyster sauce, sriracha, etc)</li>
            <li>White pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a wok or any pan nice and hot. Slice your vegetables and meats thin. <br>
                Beat your egg. Have everything ready to add to the pan, the cooking goes fast
            </li>
            <li>Put cold fat in hot pan. Add aromatics, meat, and vegetables in that general <br>
                order. Everything cooks at a different rate, and everyone has different <br>
                preferences on the doneness of each ingredient. Use your best judgement here. <br>
                I recommend not undercooking your meats, unless you like shitting your brains out.
            </li>
            <li>When these ingredients are close to desired doneness, make well in center of <br>
                pan and add beaten egg, scrambling it. You can also just crack the egg directly <br>
                into the pan and quickly scramble it, but a pre-beaten egg is easier.
            </li>
            <li>When egg is close to desired doneness, add the rice. Break up any clumps of <br>
                rice. This is easier done before its added to the pan, but you do you.
            </li>
            <li>When rice is good and hot, add your sauces and seasonings. Stir and toss <br>
                vigorously until all the moisture is absorbed or cooked off. Your friend rice <br>
                <i>should not</i> be wet.
            </li>
            <li>Its done. Put in bowl, top with sliced green onions or whatever you want.</li>
        </ol>
