        <p>These are just a few recipes that I like. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!
        </p>

        <p>NOTE: These recipes do not use exact amounts for ingredients or cook time. <br>
            I cook by feeling, and rarely measure anything I do in the kitchen. <br>
            This is simply my general thought process when I make each of these dishes. <br>
            <a href="https://media.tenor.com/kufRGlSdagEAAAAC/code-guidelines-pirates-code.gif">
            Treat these recipes more as guidelines than actual rules.
